txmpp
=====

_txmpp_ is a C++ XMPP library modified from [libjingle][libjingle] with
various bits removed and tweaked.

The motivating facter for "creating" _txmpp_ was the lack of [permissively
licenced alternatives][permissive].

If you don't mind a [copyleft][copyleft] license you might also try [gloox][gloox].
